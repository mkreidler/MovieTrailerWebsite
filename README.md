Extra Credit Description

I added more information about each title including some of Wes Anderson’s repeat choices in actors and links to analysis videos of Wes Anderson’s work. I also customized the CSS to make the project resemble the aesthetic of Wes Anderson’s films, including background images, fonts, and color changes.
